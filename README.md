# OpenGL things

The code will be in `C`.

I will share what I have learned about OpenGL here, I don't like reading docs completely. I just grab the parts I need to get where I want. So when I add resources here it does not mean you should read all of it.

## How to run OpenGL code

> [!TIP]
> Run the c files with this command `gcc ball_fall.c -o ball_exe   -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lm && ./ball_exe`
> Just replace the names

> [!WARNING]
> I'm new to `C`, in fact I'm learning both `C` and `OpenGL`.
> Just so you know I'm not a good source for good practices.

## Resources

The articles and docs I used to learn about OpenGL.

I have also used a lot of help of LLMs for explaining and what and how can I do a certain thing, I suggest you do the same.
